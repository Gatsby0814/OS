I can see what's happening 5 :26
What 1 :4
And they don't have a clue 6 :26
Who 1 :3
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line 9 :47
Our trio's down to two 5 :22
Oh 1 :2
The sweet caress of twilight 5 :28
There's magic everywhere 3 :24
And with all this romantic atmosphere 6 :37
Disaster's in the air 4 :21
Can you feel the love tonight 6 :29
The peace the evening brings 5 :28
The world for once in perfect harmony 7 :37
With all its living things 5 :26
So many things to tell her 6 :26
But how to make her see 6 :23
The truth about my past, impossible 6 :35
She'd turn away from me 5 :23
He's holding back, he's hiding 5 :30
But what, I can't decide 5 :24
Why won't he be the king I know he is? 10 :38
The king I see inside? 5 :22
Can you feel the love tonight? 6 :30
The peace the evening brings 5 :28
The world, for once, in perfect harmony 7 :39
With all its living things 5 :26
Can you feel the love tonight? 6 :30
You needn't look too far 5 :24
Stealing through the night's uncertainties 5 :42
Love is where they are 5 :22
And if he falls in love tonight 7 :31
It can be assumed 4 :17
His carefree days with us are history 7 :37
In short, our pal is doome 6 :26
